            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The states have their own elected governments while the Union Territories are ruled directly by the Government of India. As per the constitution of India, school education was originally a state subject â€”that is, the states had complete authority on deciding policies and implementing them. The role of the Government of India (GoI) was limited to coordination and deciding on the standards of higher education. This was changed with a constitutional amendment in 1976 so that education now comes in the so-called concurrent list.

The policy approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.[28] The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.</p>
